Folder Relative Path : src/UI/Pages

Place all webpage Front-end files here e.g. HTML, JS, CSS, etc.

Create a folder for each webpage

Try to minimize built in Components inside Pages. 
Check if an existing component has been created or create a Components object to call inside pages.

Pages should only have to call Components and hold UX functions.
